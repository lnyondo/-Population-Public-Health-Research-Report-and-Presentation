### Enhancing Early Detection and Management in Resource-Limited Settings
### Lusubilo Nyondo | Kudakwashe Mukumbi

### üìå Research Focus
This exploratory research project was collaboratively conducted to examine how artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics can support early detection, remote monitoring, and overall management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in underserved and resource-constrained communities.
### üí° Project Purpose
This project was carried out as part of our academic exploration in Population Health Informatics. It aims to bridge the digital divide in chronic disease care and highlight the potential of AI-driven tools in improving health outcomes where traditional healthcare access is limited.

### üß≠ Methodology
- Reviewed current AI models and predictive systems applied to diabetes care in clinical and rural contexts.
- Investigated the use of mobile applications and wearable technologies for remote diabetes monitoring.
- Explored the role of AI in clinical decision-making to enable real-time care interventions from a distance.
- Identified infrastructure limitations and user-related barriers specific to low-resource populations.
- Proposed improvements aimed at enhancing usability, scalability, and integration with national health systems.

### üîç Key Findings from Literature Rewiew
- AI algorithms can accurately predict the onset and complications of Type 2 Diabetes when using comprehensive health and behavioral datasets.
- Remote monitoring platforms reduce patient travel time and support better disease management, especially when adapted to age-specific needs.
- AI-enabled decision support tools allow providers to adjust treatments and respond to patient needs proactively.
- The following key barriers were observed:
  - Limited connectivity and digital infrastructure in rural areas.
  - Lack of model generalizability across different demographic groups.
  - Usability challenges for older adults with tech-heavy tools.
  - Fragmentation in health data systems, affecting seamless EHR integration.
 
### üë• Collaborative Contributions
- Co-developed the research framework and aligned the focus to public health priorities.
- Led the exploration of literature on predictive modeling, mobile health tools, and rural healthcare systems.
- Synthesized findings into practical recommendations tailored for resource-constrained settings.
- Conducted analysis of clinical applications of AI in diabetes care.
- Focused on usability, patient experience, and digital access challenges in remote environments.
- Contributed to documentation and visualization of key results for academic presentation.
